# MLCandNER
This project develops a text analysis pipeline for customer interactions, supporting multi-label classification, entity extraction, and summarization. Using TF-IDF, a Random Forest Classifier, and spaCy NER, it identifies competitors, features, and pricing topics. Evaluated with confusion matrices and cross-validation, itâ€™s modular and scalable.
